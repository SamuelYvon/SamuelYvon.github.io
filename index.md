## [May 22 2024] nsec 2024

I had the chance yet again to go to [nsec](https://www.nsec.io/) 2024 this year and it was... Much harder than last year. Less
hardware reverse engineering than last year left me with fewer challenges I could attack right away. I also got stuck with the
fun `rectum` challenge, which I'll write about later when I solve it myself (I do have the challenge writer's solution, but I want to understand & redo it myself). I however had
fun with the "Stem Cell" challenge, which involved a GBA game image! [Here's how I played the game](./posts/nsec2024_gba.md).

I had the chance to go to [nsec](https://www.nsec.io/) 2023 this year and it was definitely a blast. One challenge in particular,
"Office Surveillance", was an intimidating looking challenge in automatic reverse engineering, something I know nothing about. 
[Here is how I solved the first challenge of the series](./posts/nsec2023_cams.md).
